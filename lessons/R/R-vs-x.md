R is a great language especially for statistics and data processing, but it's just one of a huge number of other programming languages that you might have heard of.  Although these Data Carpentry lessons focus on the R language, once you've learned to write code you might consider looking at other tools to see which work best for you.

Some languages provide features that make them better for particular purposes, while other have been adopted and developed by particular communities.  In some cases, one language will clearly stand out as having exactly the tools you need to do your research, but in others it's more important to use the same tools as the people working around you, so that everyone can help each other.  If you're not sure, discuss it with other people in you research group or department, or talk to people at conferences.  Often the best language for you will be the one that you can most easily get help in learning.

# Python

Python can do almost everything that R can do.  It is particularly good at interfacing with mathematical algorithms implemented in C or Fortran, so that you can use those algorithms without needing to understand the language they're written in.

The downside of Python compared to R is that it has many fewer scientific and statistical functions built-in, so you're more likely to need to find packages that do what you want.

# Matlab

Matlab is a very powerful language, with a graphical user interface that makes it very easy to get started; it also has a number of commercially available toolboxes for specific applications.  Unfortunately, both Matlab itself and the toolboxes are very expensive, so if you move to a different institution you always run the risk that the particular toolbox you rely on won't be available.

# Javascript

Javascript is the language of the web, and as a result has a lot of libraries available to help present data (see, for example [D3.js](http://d3js.org/)).  However, it's designed to run within a web browser and therefore isn't very powerful and not recommended for data analysis.

# Java

Java is a good general purpose programming language, and is particularly popular in the commercial world, but isn't that popular in computational science.

# Fortran/C

Fortran and C are both languages that operate very close to the level of the CPU in your computer.  This makes it possible to write very fast, efficient code, but also means that there are a lot of opportunities to make mistakes that can crash your whole computer!
